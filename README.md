## Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice job on defining your persona - you've put careful thought and consideration into the needs of this type of client. Although your direction for your PWP is clear, I think there may be room for you to define your overall PWP Purpose Audience, and Goal in even more detail. For instance, are you more interested in securing freelance work, or are employment opportunities more what you might be looking for? The answer to this questions, and others regarding the kind of opportunities you are interested in pursuing, could affect your design and content choices for this project. For instance, based on the persona you outlined, are you particularly interested in working with freelance clients in the food/bev/hospitality industry?

Looks like the Use Case you outlined here isn't for your PWP at all, but for a hypothetical project you might build for Jasmine. And no need for the Interaction Flow here, this does not apply to your PWP. Please see the Milestone 1 Documentation and Sample Milestones for reference:
- https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-one/
- https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/

What we're looking for here is an outline of how Jasmine, your hypothetical end user, will interact with your PWP. And it should be focused on her goals as a user, and yours as the project stakeholder. 

there are some technical issues with your HTML and your .gitignore file. See Edits &amp; Suggestions below. It may help to use an HTML validator such as https://validator.w3.org/ to check your code for errors.

Unfortunately I can only pass your Milestone 1 at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) due to the Use Case not being correct. Update the Use Case and make the the changes listed below by Wednesday 7/26 8:00 a.m., and I'll bump your evaluation to Tier II.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Missing `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- Take care to use proper indention in your HTML.
- Missing `alt` attribute on line 7
- `</body>` tag should be on line 53, not 17.
- remove the .gitignore file inside of `/documentation`. You only need the .gitignore at the root of the project.
- Add `.DS_Store` to .gitignore
- In .gitignore line 2 should be `/.idea`, and 3 should be `/vendor`. These need to be fixed.
